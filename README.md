# Energy-efficient-computing

## Tentative Schedule (Draft Version 1-May-2023)
---
### Day 1  - June 15 (start 11:00 end 17:00)
- Introduction/refresher on system architecture (with examples for CPU/GPU) 
- Introduction/refresher on applications (compute/memory bound, heterogeneous, parallel) 
- Introduction/refresher on power and energy and DVFS
- Hands-on #1: tools to *inspect* CPU performance and energy consumption


### Day 2  - June 16 (start 10:00 end 17:00)

- Define energy efficiency and ways to improve energy efficiency (algorithms, scheduling, DVFS)
- Hands-on #2: DVFS by hand (using tools and system-calls and self-defined policies for reducing/increasing frequency)
- Introduce KernelTuner as a solution automate DVFS at kernel/node level, with user-intervention
- Introduce EAR as a solution for improving the energy efficiency of large-scale applications
- Hands-on #3 and #4: work with KernelTuner and EAR, choice given to the participants using a couple of pre-defined applications and/or their own applications
